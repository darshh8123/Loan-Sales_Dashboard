# Loan & Credit Score Analysis Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard for analyzing a dataset of loans and credit scores. The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from data cleaning and transformation to creating an interactive and insightful dashboard.

## Project Overview
As a data analyst, my goal was to provide data-driven insights to help financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approvals. The dashboard addresses key questions about loan distribution, approval rates, and factors influencing credit decisions.

## Key Features & Visualizations
The interactive dashboard is organized into several sections for a clear overview of loan data.

-Loan Overview: Key performance indicators (KPIs) showing the total number of loans, approved loans, and the approval rate.
-Loan & Rejection Distribution: A donut chart illustrating the ratio of approved to rejected loans.
-Credit Score Analysis: A line chart visualizing the distribution of loans by credit score, highlighting the range where most loans are approved.
-Approvals by Age Group: A bar chart showing the breakdown of approved loans across different age groups.
-Approvals by Loan Intent: A bar chart that analyzes loan approvals based on the stated purpose of the loan.

## Technical Skills & Tools
-Power BI: Used for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
-Data Analysis: Applied to identify key trends and factors influencing loan outcomes.
